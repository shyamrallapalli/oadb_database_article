# Introduction

Crowd sourcing of the massively colloborative tasks has been on the rise since the success of the astronomical data analysis application such as Galaxy zoo [ref]. In addition to taking the power citizens there are many approaches of crowd sourcing the data analysis specifically approaching other experts in the same field, such as using amazon mechanical turks, solving mathematical problem  to the latest crowdsourcing analysis of variants of E.coli outburts in Germany [ref].


A brief paragraph on ash dieback disease and the background about the destruciton caused.


From the experience of E.coli variant collective study, such a colloborative studies would of tremendous use in immediate problems such as ebola, ash dieback or oak decline and in near future as well. However such a colloborative works need a framework to faciliate the colloboration and crowd scourcing analysis data maintenance and dissemination. So to encompass the open access data policy and to faclitate crowsourced colloboration we have setup a github database and blog page to assist our work on genomic analysis of ash and ash dieback fungus. We have called this colloborative apporach as "Open Ash Die Back" (OADB) and have created a github repo at https://github.com/ash-dieback-crowdsource/data and a blog page at http://oadb.tsl.ac.uk/.

Database setup and data sharing on a crowd soucring platforms


Need for open science and reproducibility and how the github database could contribute to the solution
