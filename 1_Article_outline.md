### Introduction


### Materials Results

Crowd sourced genome analysis:
	Raw data publicly available
	Analysis parameters provided in a structed meta data format

Two major sections
1) Github data organization and pointers for future project developers
2) Ash die back data description

	Section 1 points:
		Describe folder structure:
		Organism -> strain -> subfolders

		assemblies
		annotations
		blasts
		raw data - reads
		read quality assesments

		about
		.README files
		.info files
		other metadata files

		Benefits similar folder structure for other projects intended on github

		Advantages of the github
		all activity is documented and
		contributions can be acknowledged better and problem tracking could be easier, with transparent anlysis.
		With the analysis strcture and guidance available
		these could be tremenedouls help to setup future genome analysis of quick crowd sourcing and anlysis pipelines could setup with minimal implementation times.

	Section 2 points:
		Description of data presented in the current data base
		Take few points from 1year report and any further ideas

		Explanation of data sets:
			genomes available

			transcriptomes available

			annotations available

		Specificities of Sepecies in question would have to taken in to account.
